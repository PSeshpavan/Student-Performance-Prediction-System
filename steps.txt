# End to End Data Science Project #1

# 1. Create a virtual environment
    conda create -p venv python==version_num -y

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
    Win cmd pmt: conda activate venv/
    gitbash: source activate venv/

# 3. create a requirements.txt and setup.py file in root folder
    requirements.txt will have all the required packages for the project
        to Install - pip install -r requirements.txt

    setup.py will create a package of this whole project
        to Install - python setup.py install
    We can add -e . in the requriements.txt and run the requirements.txt command and that will automatically run the setup.py file


Steps Followed to Build the Project

Project Initialization:
Created a virtual environment using Conda.
Initialized the project structure using a script to generate necessary directories and files.

Data Ingestion:
Implemented the DataIngestion class to load raw data and split it into training and testing datasets.

Data Transformation:
Built the DataTransformation class to preprocess numerical and categorical features.

Model Training:
Developed the ModelTrainer class to train multiple models and log the best-performing model using MLflow.

Version Control with DVC:
Initialized DVC in the project.
Tracked datasets, intermediate files, and model artifacts using DVC commands:
    dvc init
    dvc add data/raw.csv
    dvc add artifacts/
Committed DVC changes to Git for reproducibility.

Model Tracking with MLflow:
Configured MLflow to track experiments and log model performance.
Used MLflow to log metrics, parameters, and models during training.

Logging and Exception Handling:
Configured logging to save logs in a dedicated directory.
Added custom exception handling for better debugging.

Utilities:
Added utility functions for saving/loading objects and evaluating models.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Performed EDA and model evaluation in a Jupyter notebook.

Packaging:
Created setup.py to package the project for easy installation.
